# How to create a PHPUnit Test

- Create file with appropriate name ending with test. For Example `CreateDataProcessorTest.php`
- Follow the simplest test case file `CreateDataProcessorTest.php` for creating a test case.
- Create a function whose name starting with test. For Example `testCreateDataProcessor`. All the function starting with **test** will be evaluated, so name your utility functions properly.
- If you want to reset the Test Database and install from beginning pass `True` in `apply()` function in `setupHeadless() function`.
- Don't remove `setUp()` and `tearDown()` function from the UnitTest file.
